This is the Github repository for a virtual talk about [Oceananigans](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl) at the 2021 AGU Fall meeting.
Oceananigans is a high-level library for ocean modeling --- from idealized classroom problems to large eddy simulation of ocean boundary layers, to realistic global hydrostatic ocean models --- written in the Julia programming language to run on CPUs and GPUs.
